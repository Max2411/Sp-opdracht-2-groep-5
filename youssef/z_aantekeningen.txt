How it works.

First, read database connection parameters from the database.ini file.
Next, create a new database connection by calling the connect() function.
Then, create a new cursor and execute an SQL statement to get the PostgreSQL database version.
After that, read the result set by calling the  fetchone() method of the cursor object.
Finally, close the communication with the database server by calling the close() method of the cursor and connection objects.
